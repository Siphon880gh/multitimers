By Weng Fei Fung. Simple multiple countups with alarms that can work in the background. Customize alarms with number of beeps and text-to-speech announcements. With tap counter. This is version 2 which allows countups and timers to work in the background as an inactive tab, and had required the code to be completely reworked.
